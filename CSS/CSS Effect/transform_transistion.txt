Transform and the transition:

Transform:
The transform property modifies the spatialposition of an element. For instance, it canchange its scale and angle.

Transition:
The delay in the transformtion can be achieved by using transition property.

Let's see some of the examples:

Transform:

h1
{
    transform: rotate(0deg);
}
h1:hover
{
    transform: rotate(20deg);
}
 
 Note: Only transform will cause the transition so rapid so to overcome that we tend to use both in unison.

Transition:

h1
{
    transition: transform 2s;
}
