Introduction:
When developers want to create complex animations, they use the animation property. But to control the execution of the steps of the animation, they use the @keyframe rule. 

 The @keyframe rule specifies the name of the animation, and the individual keyframes for the animation. You define each keyframe with a keyframe selector and CSS styles for that keyframe. The @keyframe rule can also use the optional keywords, from and to, to show transitions.

 e.g.
@keyframes animationname {keyframes-selector{css-styles;}}

@keyframe animationname{
    from { color: blue;}
   to { color: red;}
}

--  You can also use % to be more specific

Animation property shorthand:

The shorthand for the animation property consists of the following properties with their default values:

animation-name: none 

animation-duration: 0s 

animation-timing-function: ease 

animation-delay: 0s 

animation-iteration-count: 1 

animation-direction: normal 

animation-fill-mode: none 

animation-play-state: running 

animation-timeline: auto 


You will know what the hell is this by following example.
<body> 

<div class="box"></div> 

</body> 

</html> 

CSS:
body{ 

padding: 30px;} 

 

.box{ 

background-color: lightcoral; 

width: 50px; 

height: 50px; 

animation: myanimation 3s infinite ease-in; 

} 

@keyframes myanimation{ 

from{width: 50px; 

} 
to{width: 100px; 

}
