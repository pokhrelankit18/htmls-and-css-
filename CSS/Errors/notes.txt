Handeling errors in CSS 

Note their is the extension in the VS code namely  Stylelint which basically does is it will gather all the styles that we doesnot want to add but we added and now it is difficult to search for each styles.

How to work with it?
Install the extension in VS code called  Stylelint
 Create and add a file called ‘.stylelinttrc.json’ to your project directory
The extension will look for this file inside any project folder you are working with. 
Add the rules in JSON object format as below, these are the same as the ones you used in ‘Handling errors’.
{ 
"rules": { 

        "alpha-value-notation": "number", 
        "selector-type-case": "lower", 
        "color-no-hex": true 
} 

}
