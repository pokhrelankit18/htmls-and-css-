Image:
It is important to ensure that screen reader accessibility software can interpret images displayed in the web browser. To support this, the <img> tag is combined with the <figure> and <figcaption> tags to provide a description of the image. The <img> tag is added inside the <figure> tag and the <figcaption> is specified after it. 

<figure> 
   <img src="photo.png" width="320" alt="My Profile Photo"> 
   <figcaption>A photo of myself on a beach in 2015</figcaption>
