iFrame:
Senerio:A small business is planning to embed advertisements on their website and you have to create an iframe to set up an image on their website. 
An iframe is HTML element that allows you to place or embed content from another website into a webpage. It's defined using the iframe HTML tag. How it works is that it embeds another browsing instance inside the page.

<iframe src="...." > </iframe>

It will impose security errors when unsecurely used. To prevent that there are some attribute that limits the behaviour of iframe.

allow attribute:(not allowing camera access and microphone access by the browser)
<iframe src=".." allow="camera 'none'; microphone 'none';"> </iframe>

sandbox attribute:(Preventing files from downloading and preventing popups)
<iframe src="" sandbox=""></iframe> --This will deny all sandbox options

You can be specific on what to allow by foing this-
<iframe src="" sandbox="allow-downloads"></iframe> 


Note: Be cautious when using iframe and use only trusted websites
