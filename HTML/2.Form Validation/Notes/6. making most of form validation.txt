Now we will learn how to make most out of client side form validates...

1)No Empty field is left
 use required attributes

2)Length of data
 i.e. for password Length 
 use" required minlength="3" maxlength="12" " to specify your length

3) Pseudo selectors
 they are used to select elements based on their state, such as whether the input data is 
 valid or invalid. Basically it uses CSS to change the color


Radio buttons:

input>type:radio
The name should be same for two radio buttons to work.

use <fieldset id="size">
    <input type="radio" value=".." name="size"> Text to be displayed
    <input type="radio" value=".." name="size" checked> Text to be displayed
    </fieldset>
use <fieldset id="location">
    <input type="radio" value=".." name="location"> Text to be displayed
    <input type="radio" value=".." name="location" checked> Text to be displayed
    </fieldset>



--- The fieldset attribute will  group your radio buttons.
Make sure you enteres the same id for fieldset and name for input tag.
-- To make responsive you should include each radio buttons in lable
