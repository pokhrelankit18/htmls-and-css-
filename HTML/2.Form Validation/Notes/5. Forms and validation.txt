Button

This displays a clickable button and it’s mostly used in HTML forms to activate a script when 
clicked. <input type="button" value="Click me" onclick="msg()" />
Keep in mind you can also define buttons with the <button> tag, with the added benefit of being
able to place content like text or images inside the tag.

Checkbox
Defines a check box allowing single values to be selected or deselected. They are used to let 
a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

Radio
Displays a radio button, allowing only a single value to be selected out of multiple choices.
They are normally presented in radio groups, which is a collection of radio buttons describing 
a set of related options that share the same "name" attribute.

Submit
Displays a submit button for submitting all values from an HTML form to a form-handler, typically
a server. The form-handler is specified in the form’s "action" attribute:

Password
Defines a single-line text field whose value is obscured, suited for sensitive information like passwords.

Date
Displays a control for entering a date with no time (year, month and day).

Datetime-local
Defines a control for entering a date and time, including the year, month and day, as well as the time in hours and minutes.

Email
Defines a field for an email address. It’s similar to a plain text input, with the addition that it validates automatically when submitted to the server.

File
Displays a control that lets the user select and upload a file from their computer. To define the types of files permissible you can use the "accept" attribute. Also, to enable multiple files to be selected, add the "multiple" attribute.

Hidden
Defines a control that is not displayed but whose value is still submitted to the server.

Image
Defines an image as a graphical submit button. You should use the “src” attribute to point to the location of your image file.

Number
Defines a control for entering a number. You can use attributes to specify restrictions, such as min and max values allowed, number intervals or a default value.

Range
Displays a range widget for specifying a number between two values. The precise value, however, is not considered important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control. To define the range of acceptable values, use the “min” and “max” properties.

Reset
Displays a button that resets the contents of the form to their default values.

Search
Defines a text field for entering a search query. These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently depending on the browser.

Time
Displays a control for entering a time value in hours and minutes, with no time zone.

Tel
Defines a control for entering a telephone number. Browsers that do not support “tel” fall back to standard text input. You can optionally use the "pattern" field to perform validation.

Url
Displays a field for entering a text URL. It works similar to a text input, but performs automatic validation before being submitted to the server.

Week
Defines a control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all the browsers.

Month
Displays a control for entering a month and year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all the browsers.
